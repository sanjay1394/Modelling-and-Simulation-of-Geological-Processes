Assign1 : V(Excess) realtionship with X(CO2) with either varying P or T

Assign2 : Activity co-efficient of H2O-CO2 binary system

Explicit : Take a linear conducting body 10 cm long and take 1cm interval (total 11 nodes). The left and the right extreme points are kept at temperatures of 100 deg C and 25 deg C respectively. The initial distribution in the 9 interior nodes is 20 deg C each. Take lambda = 0.5 and plot temperature versus space till equilibrium (see how many time steps you require). Then use these value of alpha = 1.4129 x 10 ^ -5 m^2/sec. Use delta X = 1 cm and time interval of 1s, 2s and 5s and plot the Temperature vs Space for the three time intervals and each case take 5 time steps. Upload graphs and upload code.

Assign3 : Geometry as before : length 0.05 m, 6 nodes, boundary nodes are at 100 deg and 25 deg C respectively. Take alpha as 1.4129 x 10^-5 m^2/sec. Use delta X as 0.01m and delta t as 3 s and compute temperature profile for 3 time steps using Explicit, Implicit method and Crank-Nicolson method. Compare the results.
